                    <p>Hi, I am Raphael! I am currently transitioning from a Quality Control Technician to a Full Stack Web Developer! I studied Full Stack Coding through UCSD's Extended Studies Program. I am still fairly new at coding, but I believe with my professional work experience and previous Quality experience; I can make an impact in any company I work for. I love learning and problem-solving very much. I work really well with others and consider my self a really good teammate because of my communication skills and personality </p>
                    <p>Through this bootcamp, I learned the MERN stack! It is difficult but very rewarding. I know this will further my advancement in my career goals and will definitely continue to improve in the future</p>
                    <p>Things you have to know about me: First, I am Christian. I love working in my community and in the church. I am passionate when it comes to Single Player Games. I am a big Harry Potter, Star Wars, DnD, and Anime fan. Feel free to contact me!</p>
